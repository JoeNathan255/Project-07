Theme: One Button

mechanical (one-button games)
- one-button rhythm game
- - composition is slow (reuse earlier song of mine?)
  - requires precise tuning & inventive, simple gameplay (not just DDR or ADOFAI)
  - music & sound design main concern
- stunt car driver (à la MOTO X3M)
- - simple gameplay concept
  - requires custom and careful level design
  - physics more complicated (use sphere with custom accereration stuff as car like a drift racer?)

thematic (one button in/inspiring the game)
- button at the end of a level, changes level each time pressed
- - manageable scope
  - focus on art and juiciness?
  - level design biggest concern
