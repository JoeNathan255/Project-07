# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Final Project

## Theme
I interpreted the theme thematically: The game is based around one button that regenerates the world around it when pressed.

## Game Play
Objective
Follow the instruction in the start menu and press the button until you can't anymore!

Game-play instructions
WASD or arrows to move, space to jump.

## What did you 
Struggles or surprises you encountered during the development of the game

## Implementation
Features
Assets, or resources used

## Special Focus
What is your special focus? What did you do for it? How would you rate your own effort? 1-5. (I will agree or disagree with this sentiment, but I want to know what you thought)

Theme: One Button

mechanical (one-button games)
- one-button rhythm game
- - composition is slow (reuse earlier song of mine?)
  - requires precise tuning & inventive, simple gameplay (not just DDR or ADOFAI)
  - music & sound design main concern
- stunt car driver (à la MOTO X3M)
- - simple gameplay concept
  - requires custom and careful level design
  - physics more complicated (use sphere with custom accereration stuff as car like a drift racer?)

thematic (one button in/inspiring the game)
- button at the end of a level, changes level each time pressed
- - manageable scope
  - focus on art and juiciness?
  - - animation w/ state machine? I need to practice that
  - level design is a concern
